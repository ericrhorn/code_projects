// sorting questions 
// for any sorting functions you need 2 for loops. The first loop will run through the array and the second loop will sort the remaining array (the unsorted arr)
// outer for loop only loops through the length -1 because you wont have to compair the last element with anything
// inner for loop can start at index x (var of the outer for loop) since after the first interation the first index (0) will already be locked in place 


// bubble sort - sort an array from lowest to hightst




// insertion sort
// insertion sort - starts at the second element and sorts left - second compairs to first, third compairs to second and so on

// another way to do this with a while loop.  



// selection sort
// selection sort - find the minimum value in the arr and move it to the front


// selection sort with a more pure function (this does not mutate or alter the original function)



// sort with built in js function

// assending 

// decending 

// reverse an array
// Reverse Array - Given an array, write a function that reverses its values, in-place.  Example: reverse([3,1,6,4,2]) returns the same array, but now contains values reversed like so... [2,4,6,1,3].  Do this without creating an empty temporary array.  (Hint: you'll need to swap values).


// swap towards center
// Swap Toward the Center - Given an array, swap the first and last values, third and third-to-last values, etc.  Example: swapTowardCenter([true,42,"Ada",2,"pizza"]) turns the array into ["pizza", 42, "Ada", 2, true].  swapTowardCenter([1,2,3,4,5,6]) turns the array into [6,2,4,3,5,1].  No need to return the array this time.
